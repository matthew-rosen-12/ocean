most changes that you make will require the human to play the game and look at console output in browser.
the human has already started the game with `npm run dev` in both the `backend` and `frontend` folders and code changes are automatically reflected in the game.
you can verify code changes still compile with `npm run build` in the `backend` or `frontend` folder
ask the human to verify changes by playing the game whenever there's been a signicant, complete change. and create a git commit for every set of code changes that gets verified by the human
