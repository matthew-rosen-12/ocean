- create llm calls for npc speech - upgrade tier?
- quality assurance (test both local vs bot and local vs local)
    - on emission then instant recapture, number does not increase correctly, sometimes duplicate collision from npc group, user capture twice not work if too close together 

- add instructions
    - make instructions align with background grid but hardcoding grid zoom scale
    - copy edit ('charge up and release to throw'?)
    -   group interactions section is wrong

- make publicly available
