- create llm calls for npc speech - upgrade tier?
- quality assurance (test both local vs bot and local vs local)
    - ? lerp following npc group on slow render so it's less jumpy
    - on emission then instant recapture, number does not increase correctly, sometimes duplicate collision
    - new user doesn't see existing user's existing npc group on login!

- add instructions

- make publicly available
