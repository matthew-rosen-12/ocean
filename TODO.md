- create llm calls for npc speech - upgrade tier?
- quality assurance (test both local vs bot and local vs local)
    - ? lerp following npc group on slow render so it's less jumpy
    - ? why way faster on safari? speed up on firefox
    - sometimes path timestamp is undefined
    - on emission then instant recapture, number does not increase correctly

- ? adjust frosted glass text on background color or make npc / animal backgrounds darker

- make publicly available
