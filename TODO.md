- create llm calls for npc speech - upgrade tier?
- quality assurance (test both local vs bot and local vs local)
    - ? lerp following npc group on slow render so it's less jumpy
    - sometimes path timestamp is undefined
    - on emission then instant recapture, number does not increase correctly
    - make inactive if collisions not being detected (maybe has to do with multiple tabs running same game at once?)

- add instructions

- make publicly available
