- create llm calls for npc speech - upgrade tier?
- quality assurance (test both local vs bot and local vs local)
    - ? lerp following npc group on slow render so it's less jumpy (tune and clean up)
    - on emission then instant recapture, number does not increase correctly, sometimes duplicate collision from npc group, user capture twice not work if too close together 

- add instructions

- make publicly available
