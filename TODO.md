- create llm calls for npc speech - upgrade tier?
- quality assurance (test both local vs bot and local vs local)
    - on emission then instant recapture, number does not increase correctly
    - sometimes path timestamp gets undefined (made sure to change npc phase before deleting path and set fallback to npc position when path position undefined) - might be fixed
- memory leaks of safari??
- lag on new player join or new message
- lagginess of following npc group still
- outline is flashing on cinematic zoom over still
- (one final check)


- code cleanup
- make publicly available
