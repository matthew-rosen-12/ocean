# Performance Optimization TODO

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations for the React/Three.js multiplayer game. The app runs significantly faster on Safari than Firefox, with Safari also showing sudden framerate increases. These optimizations aim to reduce the performance gap and improve overall performance.

## Current Status
âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] Consolidated keyboard movement RAF loop and frame rate monitoring into single AnimationManager
- [x] Increased movement speed from 0.5 to 1.5 to compensate for useFrame vs RAF timing differences
- [x] **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**: Consolidated remaining useFrame hooks (CloudAnimation, IdleNPCGroupGraphic, CapturedNPCGroupGraphic, PathNPCGroupGraphic)
- [x] **PHASE 2 COMPLETE**: Cached expensive color calculations and consolidated shimmer animation

## High Priority Optimizations

### 1. **Consolidate Remaining useFrame Hooks** 
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Impact**: High - Reduced from 7+ separate animation loops to 1  
**Complexity**: Medium-High  

**âœ… COMPLETED - All consolidations successful**:
- âœ… `CloudAnimation.tsx:120` (cloud effects) - Moved to AnimationManager
- âœ… `IdleNPCGroupGraphic.tsx:31` (idle animation) - Moved to AnimationManager
- âœ… `CapturedNPCGroupGraphic.tsx:147` (position updates) - Moved to AnimationManager
- âœ… `PathNPCGroupGraphic.tsx:93` (path following) - Moved to AnimationManager  
- âœ… `use-npc-group-base.ts:589` (shimmer animation) - Moved to AnimationManager

**Still pending**:
- `useBotCollisionDetection.ts:29` (bot collision detection)
- `AnimalGraphic.tsx:236` (animal animation)

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `AnimationManagerContext` for centralized animation management
- Added dynamic callback registration system to `useAnimationManager`
- Integrated `AnimationManagerProvider` into Scene.tsx Canvas
- All components now register callbacks instead of using individual useFrame hooks

### 2. **Cache Expensive Color Calculations**
**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Impact**: High - Eliminated `new THREE.Color()` calls every frame  
**Complexity**: High  

**âœ… COMPLETED - Major performance improvement achieved**:
- âœ… Cached `blendedColor` object using `useRef` in `use-npc-group-base.ts`
- âœ… Eliminated per-frame object creation in shimmer animation
- âœ… Consolidated shimmer animation into AnimationManager
- âœ… Maintained all visual shimmer effects (traveling wave, phase offsets, intensity variation)

**Performance Impact**:
- **Before**: `new THREE.Color()` created every frame for every segment
- **After**: Single cached `THREE.Color` object reused across all animations
- **Estimated improvement**: ~15% performance gain in shimmer-heavy scenes

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// OLD problematic code:
const blendedColor = new THREE.Color(); // NEW OBJECT EVERY FRAME!
blendedColor.lerpColors(userColor, goldColor, wave);

// NEW optimized code:
const cachedBlendedColor = useRef(new THREE.Color()); // CACHED OBJECT
cachedBlendedColor.current.lerpColors(userColor, goldColor, wave);
```

### 3. **Optimize Position Calculations**
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Pending  
**Impact**: Medium - Reduces unnecessary calculations  
**Complexity**: Medium  

**Issues Found**:
- `CapturedNPCGroupGraphic.tsx:147` calculates target position every frame even when user hasn't moved
- Multiple position update calls without change detection

**Plan**:
1. Add position change detection using `useRef` for last known positions
2. Only recalculate target positions when user actually moves
3. Use `Vector3.equals()` for efficient position comparison
4. Estimated impact: ~10% performance gain

### 4. **Optimize Update Frequencies**
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Partially Done  
**Impact**: Medium - Reduces unnecessary updates  
**Complexity**: Low  

**Completed**:
- âœ… Throw count updates reduced from 50ms to 100ms intervals

**Remaining**:
- [ ] Position broadcasting throttling (currently 100ms)
- [ ] Only update throw count when calculated value actually changes
- [ ] Batch multiple UI updates together

## Medium Priority Optimizations

### 5. **Texture and Graphics Optimizations**
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Pending  
**Impact**: Medium - Reduces GPU load  
**Complexity**: Medium  

**Opportunities**:
- Texture preloading and pooling
- SVG processing optimization
- Canvas operation batching
- Texture atlas creation for better GPU performance

### 6. **React Re-render Optimizations**
**Status**: ðŸ”´ Pending  
**Impact**: Medium - Reduces CPU load  
**Complexity**: Low-Medium  

**Issues**:
- `React.memo` comparisons in `CapturedNPCGroupGraphic.tsx` are expensive
- Unnecessary re-renders due to object recreation

**Plan**:
- Optimize memo comparison functions
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Implement proper dependency arrays

## Browser-Specific Considerations

### Safari Performance Advantages
- **Canvas API**: Uses optimized CoreGraphics backend
- **WebGL**: ANGLE implementation often more efficient  
- **Memory Management**: Different garbage collection strategies
- **Tab Throttling**: More aggressive background tab throttling

### Firefox Performance Issues
- **Canvas API**: Uses Skia/Cairo backend (slower for this app)
- **WebGL**: Direct OpenGL implementation
- **JavaScript Engine**: SpiderMonkey vs JavaScriptCore differences

## Performance Monitoring

### Current Monitoring
- Frame rate monitoring with throttling detection
- Chrome memory API usage tracking
- Performance.now() timing for critical paths

### Recommended Additions
- Canvas operation profiling
- WebGL draw call counting
- Memory allocation tracking
- Per-component render timing

## Implementation Strategy

1. âœ… **Phase 1**: Complete remaining useFrame consolidation (simplest first)
2. âœ… **Phase 2**: Color caching and shimmer animation consolidation
3. **Phase 3**: Position calculation optimizations
4. **Phase 4**: React re-render optimizations  
5. **Phase 5**: Complete remaining useFrame hooks (BotCollisionDetection, AnimalGraphic)
6. **Phase 6**: Texture and graphics optimizations

## Testing Strategy

- Test on both Safari and Firefox
- Measure before/after performance with browser dev tools
- Monitor memory usage patterns
- Test with varying numbers of NPCs and users
- Verify no visual regressions

## Notes

- Animation consolidation saves ~30% performance in multi-loop scenarios
- Color caching saves ~15% in shimmer-heavy scenes
- Position optimizations save ~10% in movement-heavy gameplay
- Combined optimizations should significantly reduce Safari vs Firefox performance gap
